Make sure the logic is reasonably sound and reliable
Do not adjust the parameters for now. Only fix code to make backtesting work
Try not to reinvent the wheel. Use existing code and infrastructure whenever possible.

I am backtesting the stat arb strategy. Backtest results are stored in the results folder, which you can rely on for analysis for model and strategy improvements. 

# Backtesting Infrastructure Rules

## Core Infrastructure (DO NOT MODIFY)
1. **Data Pipeline**
   - Historical data loading and preprocessing
   - Data validation and error handling
   - Time series management
   - Data synchronization across pairs

2. **Risk Management Framework**
   - Position sizing logic
   - Stop loss and take profit calculation
   - Leverage limits
   - Commission handling
   - Risk per trade limits

3. **Performance Tracking**
   - Trade execution logging
   - PnL calculation
   - Capital curve tracking
   - Performance metrics calculation
   - Results export functionality

4. **Backtest Engine**
   - Time step iteration
   - Signal processing
   - Trade execution
   - Portfolio management
   - Error handling and logging

## Strategy Implementation (MODIFY ONLY THIS)
1. **Signal Generation**
   - Statistical arbitrage logic
   - Cointegration testing
   - Spread calculation
   - Entry/exit conditions
   - Signal validation

2. **Strategy Parameters**
   - Lookback periods
   - Z-score thresholds
   - Position sizing rules
   - Rebalancing frequency
   - Exit conditions

3. **Strategy-Specific Features**
   - Pair selection logic
   - Spread normalization
   - Mean reversion parameters
   - Correlation thresholds
   - Volatility filters

## Error Handling Rules
1. If an error occurs in the strategy implementation:
   - Log the error with context
   - Skip the current iteration
   - Continue with the backtest
   - Do not modify the infrastructure

2. If an error occurs in the core infrastructure:
   - Log the error with full details
   - Stop the backtest
   - Report the issue
   - Do not attempt to fix the infrastructure

## Testing Protocol
1. Test new strategy implementations:
   - On small time periods first
   - With reduced position sizes
   - With detailed logging enabled
   - Without modifying infrastructure

2. Validate results:
   - Check trade execution
   - Verify position sizing
   - Confirm risk management
   - Review performance metrics

## Documentation Requirements
1. Strategy Implementation:
   - Document all strategy parameters
   - Explain signal generation logic
   - Detail risk management rules
   - Provide usage examples

2. Error Handling:
   - Document expected errors
   - Provide error recovery procedures
   - List known limitations
   - Include troubleshooting steps
