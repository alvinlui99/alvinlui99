- **Initial Asset Selection**: Top 10 liquid crypto pairs by volume
- **Data Requirements**:
  - Historical price data (minimum 6 months)
  - Volume data
  - Order book snapshots
  - Market depth information
- **Current Status**: ✅ Implemented and tested

### 2. Pair Selection Process
1. **Liquidity Screening**:
   - Minimum 24h volume > $100M
   - Maximum spread < 0.1%
   - Current Status: ✅ Implemented and tested

2. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Calculate correlations between pairs
   - Minimum correlation threshold: 0.7
   - Current Status: ✅ Implemented and tested

3. **Cointegration Testing**:
   - Engle-Granger test
   - Select pairs with significant cointegration (p-value < 0.05)
   - Current Status: ✅ Implemented and tested

4. **Selected Pairs** (as of March 31, 2024):
   ```
   ['LINKUSDT', 'NEARUSDT', 'WIFUSDT', 'TRUMPUSDT', 'AVAXUSDT', 
    '1000SHIBUSDT', 'WLDUSDT', 'ETHUSDT', 'DOGEUSDT', '1000PEPEUSDT']
   ```

### 3. Trading Logic

#### Entry Conditions
1. **Statistical Significance**:
   - Z-score calculation for price spread
   - Entry when |Z-score| > 1.5 (adjusted for testing)
   - Direction based on mean reversion expectation
   - Current Status: ✅ Implemented and tested

2. **Position Sizing**:
   - Dynamic sizing based on Z-score confidence
   - Maximum position size: 20% of portfolio
   - Minimum confidence threshold: 0.4
   - Volatility threshold: 0.05
   - Current Status: ✅ Implemented and tested

3. **Risk Management**:
   - Dynamic stop-loss based on volatility
   - Maximum position size per pair: 20% of portfolio
   - Current Status: ✅ Implemented and tested

#### Exit Conditions
1. **Statistical**:
   - Z-score normalization
   - Take profit at |Z-score| < 0.5
   - Stop loss at |Z-score| > 3.0
   - Current Status: ✅ Implemented and tested

### 4. Risk Management

#### Portfolio Level
- Maximum drawdown: 25%
- Maximum exposure per asset: 20%
- Maximum total leverage: 2x
- Daily loss limit: 5%

#### Position Level
- Dynamic position sizing based on:
  - Statistical confidence (Z-score magnitude)
  - Volatility (spread standard deviation)
  - Correlation stability
  - Market regime

### 5. Performance Metrics
- Sharpe ratio
- Maximum drawdown
- Win rate
- Number of trades
- Total PnL
- Return percentage
- Trade history

2. Maximum drawdown < 25%
3. Win rate > 60%
4. Profit factor > 1.5
5. Average trade duration < 4 hours

## Quick Testing

The strategy supports quick testing through the `test_duration_hours` parameter, which allows you to run shorter backtests for development and debugging purposes.

### Configuration

```python
config = {
    'strategy_version': 'v2',
    'symbols': ['BTCUSDT', 'ETHUSDT'],
    'timeframe': '15m',
    'test_duration_hours': 1  # Quick test with 1 hour of data
}
```

### Implementation Details

The quick testing feature works by:

1. **Data Limitation**
   - Only loads the most recent N hours of data
   - Maintains data consistency across all symbols
   - Preserves the train/test/val split proportionally

2. **Performance Impact**
   - Significantly reduces backtest runtime
   - Lowers memory requirements
   - Enables faster iteration during development

3. **Use Cases**
   - Strategy development and debugging
   - Parameter optimization
   - Capital change validation
   - Quick performance checks

### Best Practices

1. **Development Workflow**
   - Use quick tests (1-2 hours) during development
   - Run full backtests before major changes
   - Validate results with different time periods

2. **Parameter Testing**
   - Test parameter changes with quick tests first
   - Verify capital changes and position sizing
   - Check signal generation and execution

3. **Production Considerations**
   - Always run full backtests before deployment
   - Consider market conditions in test period
   - Validate results across different timeframes

### Example Usage

```python
# Quick test configuration
config = {
    'test_duration_hours': 1,
    'initial_capital': 10000.0,
    'max_position_size': 0.1,
    'stop_loss': 0.02,
    'take_profit': 0.03
}

# Run backtest
results = backtest_strategy(data, **config)
```

### Limitations

1. **Representativeness**
   - Short test periods may not capture all market conditions
   - Results may not reflect long-term performance
   - Limited sample size for statistical significance

2. **Data Requirements**
   - Requires recent data for all symbols
   - May miss important market events
   - Limited training data for strategy parameters

3. **Validation**
   - Quick tests should be validated with full backtests
   - Consider market conditions during test period
   - Check for data quality and consistency
