# Algorithm Trading Rules

## Strategy Parameters

### Spread Calculation
```python
spread_multiplier = 1000  # Increased sensitivity to small price changes
min_spread_std = 0.01    # Minimum standard deviation threshold (1%)
min_spread = 0.01        # Minimum spread value threshold (1%)
```

### Position Sizing
```python
max_position_size = 0.1  # Maximum 10% of capital per trade
initial_capital = 10000  # Starting capital
```

### Risk Management
```python
base_stop_loss = 0.02   # 2% base stop loss
base_take_profit = 0.03 # 3% base take profit
min_correlation = 0.7   # Minimum correlation for pair selection
```

## Trading Rules

### Entry Rules
1. Calculate normalized spread between asset pairs
2. Verify minimum correlation threshold
3. Check spread standard deviation meets minimum requirement
4. Confirm spread value exceeds minimum threshold
5. Calculate dynamic stop-loss and take-profit levels
6. Execute trade if all conditions are met

### Exit Rules
1. Monitor spread for mean reversion
2. Check stop-loss and take-profit levels
3. Exit position if:
   - Take-profit level is reached
   - Stop-loss level is breached
   - Spread returns to mean
   - Maximum holding period exceeded

### Risk Management Rules
1. Never exceed maximum position size
2. Adjust position size based on volatility
3. Maintain minimum correlation threshold
4. Monitor drawdown limits
5. Regular rebalancing of positions

## Performance Monitoring
1. Track daily returns
2. Monitor Sharpe ratio
3. Calculate maximum drawdown
4. Track win rate
5. Monitor average profit per trade
6. Regular strategy review and parameter optimization

## Market Conditions
The strategy performs best when:
1. Asset pairs show high correlation (>0.7)
2. Market exhibits mean reversion behavior
3. Sufficient liquidity exists
4. Volatility is moderate
5. Trading costs are reasonable
