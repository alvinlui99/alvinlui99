# Portfolio ML Model Documentation

## Overview
This machine learning model is designed for portfolio weight prediction, utilizing both asset-specific and market-wide features to optimize asset allocation.

## Model Architecture
- Base: LightGBM with MultiOutputRegressor
- Feature Processing: StandardScaler
- Output: Portfolio weights normalized to sum to 1

## Key Features
- Combined asset-specific and market-wide feature processing
- Automated weight normalization and non-negative constraints
- Market aggregate statistics generation
- Multi-asset simultaneous prediction

## Strengths

### Feature Engineering
- Effective combination of asset-specific and market-wide features
- Market statistics aggregation (mean, std) for each feature
- Robust multi-asset data structure handling

### Model Architecture
- LightGBM efficiency for large datasets
- MultiOutputRegressor for simultaneous multi-asset prediction
- Optimized default hyperparameters

### Data Processing
- NaN value handling
- Feature standardization
- Timestamp alignment across assets

### Weight Management
- Non-negative weight enforcement
- Weight normalization to 100%
- Equal weight fallback mechanism

## Known Vulnerabilities

### Model Risk
- [ ] Missing cross-validation
- [ ] No validation set splitting
- [ ] No overfitting prevention
- [ ] Lack of performance metrics
- [ ] No feature importance analysis

### Portfolio Construction
- [ ] Missing risk management framework
- [ ] No transaction cost consideration
- [ ] No asset correlation analysis
- [ ] Absence of portfolio turnover constraints

### Data Handling
- [ ] Look-ahead bias vulnerability
- [ ] No outlier handling
- [ ] Market regime changes not considered

### Implementation
- [ ] Limited error handling
- [ ] No logging system
- [ ] Missing model persistence
- [ ] No incremental model updates

## Improvement Roadmap

### High Priority
1. Implement cross-validation and train/validation/test split
2. Add risk management constraints
3. Develop feature importance analysis
4. Integrate transaction costs

### Medium Priority
5. Add position limits and turnover constraints
6. Implement logging and model persistence
7. Develop performance metrics tracking
8. Enhance portfolio optimization with risk measures

### Future Enhancements
9. Add market regime detection
10. Implement rolling window training
