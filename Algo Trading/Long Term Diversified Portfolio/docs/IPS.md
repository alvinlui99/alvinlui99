# Personal Investment Strategy

## Purpose

The goal of this portfolio is to sustain **perpetual capital** while supporting an **annual withdrawal of 5%**, funded through a combination of dividends, bond coupons, and strategic sales. This portfolio exists **outside of regular income or cashflow needs** and is designed for **long-term wealth growth** and **active capital allocation**.

## Objectives

- **Primary goal**: Sustain perpetual capital while enabling annual withdrawals of 5% of the portfolio value.
- **Target return**: ≥ 5% per annum over a long-term horizon.
- **Time horizon**: Perpetual / indefinite.
- **Withdrawal frequency**: Annually (can be reassessed as needed).

## Risk Profile

- **Risk tolerance**: High — comfortable with market volatility and short-term drawdowns in pursuit of long-term capital appreciation.
- **Capacity to bear loss**: Strong — job income covers all personal expenses and separate crypto allocation exists.
- **Investment knowledge**: Advanced — Fellow of the Society of Actuaries with a specialization in quantitative finance and investments.
