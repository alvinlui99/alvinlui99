# Personal Investment Strategy

## Purpose

The goal of this portfolio is to sustain perpetual capital while supporting an annual withdrawal of 5%, funded through a combination of dividends, bond coupons, and strategic sales. This portfolio exists outside of regular income or cashflow needs and is meant for long-term wealth growth and active capital allocation.

## Objectives

- **Primary goal**: Sustain perpetual capital while enabling annual withdrawals of 5% of the portfolio value.
- **Target return**: ≥ 5% per annum over a long-term horizon.
- **Time horizon**: Perpetual / indefinite.
- **Withdrawal frequency**: Annually (can be reassessed as needed).

## Risk Profile

- **Risk tolerance**: High — comfortable with market volatility and short-term drawdowns in pursuit of long-term capital appreciation.
- **Capacity to bear loss**: Strong — job income covers all personal expenses and separate crypto allocation exists.
- **Investment knowledge**: Advanced — Fellow of the Society of Actuaries with a specialization in quantitative finance and investments.

## Asset Allocation

Initial target mix (to be reviewed annually):

| Asset Class   | Allocation | Notes                                                             |
|---------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| US Equities   | 65%        | Mix of large-cap growth, value, and small/mid-cap across sectors. |
| Fixed Income  | 30%        | Mix of US Treasuries and BB-rated corporate bonds.                |
| Cash (USD)    | 5%         | Withdrawal buffer and tactical capital.                           |

*Allocation to be reviewed periodically based on opportunity, valuation shifts, or macroeconomic considerations.*

## Equity Strategy

- Focus on US-listed securities on NASDAQ/NYSE.
- Broad diversification across sectors and styles (blend of value and growth).
- Open to factor tilts depending on market regime (e.g., overweight quality or momentum when appropriate).
- Preference for direct equity ownership for flexibility and tactical positioning.

## Fixed Income Strategy

- ~50% US Treasuries: duration to be actively managed depending on yield curve and rate outlook.
- ~50% Corporate bonds: target average BB credit quality; may include select high-yield instruments.
- May include TIPS or floating-rate notes tactically for inflation exposure or rate hedging.

## Rebalancing Strategy

- **Scheduled Rebalance**: Semiannually (January and July).
- **Interim Rebalance**: Triggered if any major asset class deviates by more than ±5% from target.
- Use rebalancing opportunities to trim stretched positions and reallocate to undervalued areas.

## Implementation

- **Broker**: Interactive Brokers (IBKR)
- **Platform**: Trading managed through API (algorithmic access).
- **Securities**: Direct investments in stocks and bonds (minimal use of ETFs unless tactical).

## Behavioral & Tactical Notes

- Stay grounded in fundamentals and macro outlook; avoid reactionary trades based on short-term volatility.
- Tactical deviations from the strategic allocation are permitted but should be clearly documented.
- Crypto and other speculative assets are managed in a separate portfolio.

## Review Process

- **Annual strategy review**: Update return assumptions, withdrawal needs, and asset allocation.
- **Performance tracking**: Monthly or quarterly, benchmarked against:
  - 65% S&P 500 Total Return Index
  - 30% Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index
  - 5% ICE BofA 1-3 Month Treasury Bill Index
