# Backtesting

This directory contains scripts for backtesting the trained models on historical data.

## Purpose

The backtesting process is used to evaluate the performance of trading strategies on historical data. This helps in assessing the viability of a strategy before deploying it in real-world trading.

## Data Source

The backtesting scripts use the reserved test data stored in `data/backtest/`. This data was separated during the model training process and represents 20% of the most recent data.

## Available Scripts

(Scripts will be added as they are developed)

## How to Run

Instructions for running backtesting scripts will be added as they are developed.

## Expected Metrics

The backtesting scripts will generate and report the following metrics:
- Total return
- Annualized return
- Sharpe ratio
- Maximum drawdown
- Win rate
- Average win/loss ratio
- Number of trades
